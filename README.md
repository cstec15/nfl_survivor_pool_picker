# NFL Survivor Pool Picking Strategy Tester and Optimizer 🏈
An interactive data science tool to simulate and identify optimal picking strategies in NFL Survivor Pools using historical and simulated betting data.


## 🎯 Goal

This project aims to explore and identify the best picking strategies for NFL Survivor Pools. By simulating thousands of seasons using real historical data and bookmaker odds, the project evaluates different picking algorithms to determine which offers the highest average weeks survived and expected value in competitive pool settings.


## 📊 Data Sources

- **Historical NFL Odds and Results**: Collected from [Australia Sports Betting](https://www.aussportsbetting.com/data/historical-nfl-results-and-odds-data/)
- **NFL Schedules (Historical and Upcoming)**: Collected from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2024/games.htm)
- **Upcoming Season Odds**: Retrieved via API from [the-odds-api](https://the-odds-api.com)

## 🔍 Strategy Formulation Process

1. **Two Goals**: Maximize number of weeks survived and maximize winnings when playing against various strategies in a Survivor Pool.
2. **Picker Classes**:
    - `Picker`: Picks a random team each week
    - `BestOddsPicker`: Always picks the team with the best odds
    - `TopKOddsPicker`: Picks among the top K teams with best odds
    - `MaxOddsPicker`: Picks each week based on the combination of teams that maximizes survival probability over the entire season. Uses the Hungarian Algorithm to do this efficiently
    - `MaxOddsWithDecayPicker`: Same logic as above, but introduces a decay factor to put more weight on picking early weeks correctly
    - `SlidingWindowPicker`: Same logic as above, except that it maximizes the surivival probability over a predefined window of games, as opposed to the whole season, and picks according to that
3. **Evaluation Logic**:
    - Each picker is evaluated across different season datasets.
    - Pickers are measured on how many weeks they survive on average across thousands of simulations 
    - Pickers are also evaluated against one another on simulations based on their expected proportion of the pot they expect to win

## 📈 Final Results: Average Weeks Survived
